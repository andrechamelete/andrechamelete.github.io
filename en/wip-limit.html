                    <p>
                        We all have an intrinsic capacity limit for any task we consider performing. You can read X pages per hour, carry Y kilos at a time, type N words per minute.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">Why limit WiP?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Imagine that you are moving and are going to load your belongings onto the truck. You realize that you can safely carry 2 boxes at a time. If, to move faster, you try to carry 4, one of them might fall over halfway, or you might lose your balance and break some things, or even hurt yourself.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        See, when we don't respect capacity, problems can occur.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It's the same thing in your work: if you need to do twice as much in the same day, you'll have to sacrifice quality for speed. This low quality will result in errors and rework, as well as customer dissatisfaction.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, there is stress when we have started work but not finished due to the emergence of another demand. We are left thinking “I need to finish this quickly so I can get back to that as soon as possible”. In other words, such tension reduces your focus.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Finally, if there is more work than the team can handle, there will be stress due to overload, burnout issues and, if urgent work is needed, more demands will be put on hold.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The second Kanban practice, Limiting WiP (work in progress), in addition to everything mentioned above, has a mathematical basis:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Lead Time = WiP / Throughput
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>   
                        So, the higher the amount of work in progress, the longer the delivery time. So if you want to deliver faster, reduce your WiP.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Initially, we can mention the following benefits when using the WiP Limit practice: protection against capacity abuse, stress reduction, more satisfied employees, reduced delivery time, higher quality, more satisfied customers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Going further, the WiP Limit also helps visualize efficiency issues in the flow.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This practice is what differentiates a pull system from a push system. When there is no limit, everything that arrives is pushed into the flow. When there is, and this is reached, only when one demand is completed can another enter (be pulled). We focus on finishing what we started.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Limiting your WiP brings obstacles to the surface. Imagine you are crossing a river in a small boat. Looking from above, you cannot see where the banks and rocks are, hidden by the water, but if you pass over one of them, it will cause damage to the boat and impede your journey. In other words, you may not see the problem, but it is hindering you.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Here, limiting the WiP would be like lowering the water level to see the barriers. In the river this is not possible, but in its flow it is.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Suppose you have a 6-step service (A to F), and you limit the system's WiP to 30. After some time you notice the following behavior:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Since we have a limit for the flow as a whole, the bottleneck ends up accumulating a large part of the demands. At this point, nothing more can be pulled, the system already has 30 items.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's limit it to 5 per step instead of 30 for the system. After some time you see the following arrangement:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Here, the bottleneck is not able to feed the next stage very well. And, probably, the stages before it have demands already completed, waiting for D to unblock the flow.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        At first glance, this practice may seem bad, after all, it seems that the limit is obstructing the work. But it is not the limit, but the bottleneck. Remember the Theory of Constraint: the flow rate is conditioned by its least efficient stage, just as the strength of the chain is limited to its weakest link. In other words, if one stage has a flow rate of 1 item per week while the others can do 5, its average flow rate will be 1 per week.                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And now, with this “pain” on the surface, it is possible to engage people to solve the problem at its root (in the efficiency of step D), instead of pushing it under the rug, pulling more demands and congesting the system.
