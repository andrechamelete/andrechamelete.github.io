                    <p>
                        Every company aims to stay profitable and relevant. To achieve this, it must constantly evolve, adapt to market variability, and deliver 
                        solutions that increasingly meet customer needs. But how can a culture of continuous improvement be fostered to keep up with all this?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The behavior of any group is guided by its culture. According to Edgar Schein, culture is "a set of basic assumptions that a group has 
                        invented, discovered, or developed to handle external adaptation and internal integration problems, and that have worked well enough 
                        to be considered valid and taught to new members as the correct way to address these issues."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In other words, lasting changes generally arise from within, as a response to key challenges. Thus, transformations imposed externally 
                        or from the top down within an organization tend to fail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here, the issue is not about "those in power making decisions." We are talking about human behavior, and as much as we may be inclined 
                        to order improvements, we must seek the best approach for them to be genuinely implemented and sustained over time. If changes aren't f
                        ully executed or fail to address true challenges, the issues will persist. And we know that managers and business owners want the best 
                        for their company above all else.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">How to Foster Evolution?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Let's think, for example, of a sedentary person. No matter how much others highlight this as harmful, if that person doesn't perceive 
                        it that way, they will probably take no action to improve. Conversely, when it starts impacting their life, they will be motivated to take action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Similarly, when a company enforces an adjustment without people perceiving it as an appropriate response to a real issue, they either won't 
                        do it or may pretend to, which won't yield effective results. However, if we can develop strategies to find the root causes of problems and 
                        mobilize people, we can achieve a change that integrates with organizational culture and leads to improvement.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">The Three Factors of Evolution</h2>

                    <p>
                        Every lasting change occurs through three factors: stressors, leadership actions, and points of reflection. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stressors</h3>

                    <p>
                        Stressors These are like warning signs, aspects, or situations that create an appropriate level of discomfort, motivating people to take action. 
                        Returning to the example of a sedentary lifestyle, noticing shortness of breath during tasks, constant fatigue, and the real impact on their 
                        life will drive the individual to take action.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Leadership actions</h3>

                    <p>
                        With the perception of the right stressors, people tend to mobilize, seeking solutions to address the problem. These initiatives are 
                        leadership actions, such as starting physical exercise in our example of sedentary behavior.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reflection points</h3>

                    <p>
                        As actions are taken to solve the problem, it's also essential to measure progress. In the example, it might be about being able to walk 
                        or run for a longer time or distance (if these are actions taken), or even in daily tasks, like feeling less tired.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">What about organizations?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Imagine a company facing a scenario of unpredictability, missed deadlines, and dissatisfied customers. What stressors can be introduced 
                        to drive evolution?
                    </p>

                    <p>   
                        A good starting point may be visual management. By mapping service flows and their demands, bottlenecks (steps with an excessive workload), 
                        demands approaching the delivery date, and other challenges become visible. When this is made clear to teams, employees will feel inclined 
                        to act. If management supports the teams, people will start taking actions to improve what's not working.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Here, we begin to create a stressor (visualizing the flow and demands, as well as their bottlenecks) and foster leadership actions among 
                        employees. Then it's time to implement the third factor. We can, for example, measure delivery time (the period between a customer's order 
                        and receipt). If this starts to decrease, it's a good sign that things are on the right track. Otherwise, it raises the need to consider 
                        new strategies and learn from what didn't work.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">When do transformations fail?</h2>

                    <p>
                        It's very common for managers and employees to attend training on agile methodologies, for example, and return excited to implement them 
                        comprehensively. By doing so, a common failure pattern known as "overreaching" likely occurs. This happens when companies try to implement 
                        overly large changes that go beyond the most urgent issues, resulting in a need for relearning, confusion, and excessive stress, which 
                        leads to a negative efficiency curve before achieving any benefits (if it reaches them at all). Change management first involves managing 
                        stress and people's commitment to the necessary evolution.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">The principles do change management</h2>

                    <p>
                        An effective way to manage this situation and achieve the desired results is to follow the principles of change management, as introduced 
                        by the Kanban method:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Start with what you do now</h3>

                    <p>
                        Understand the current reality, map flows, record important demand information, and everything that reflects how the company operates now. 
                        A journey begins from the starting point: no one travels from one city to another without first knowing where they currently are.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Agree to pursue improvement through evolutionary change</h3>

                    <p>
                        As we mentioned before, it's pointless to try to solve everything in one day. Begin with the main issue, the one everyone perceives as 
                        a significant problem, and aim to resolve this first with team commitment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Encourage acts of leadership at every level</h3>

                    <p>
                        Leadership acts are any actions toward improvement, whether asking for help, reporting a problem, or making a suggestion. When people feel 
                        they can bring “bad news” without punishment, problems get resolved in a timely manner rather than being discovered too late. Allow and 
                        encourage employees to contribute not only by following orders but also by thinking and suggesting possible actions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>
                        Change management is essential to maintain competitiveness and relevance in a dynamic market. By creating a culture of continuous 
                        improvement where all employees play an active role, changes become responses to organizational needs rather than imposed actions. 
                        With leadership support and practices focused on visibility, stress management, and result measurement, companies can evolve sustainably, 
                        avoid failure, and overcome obstacles. Ultimately, promoting effective change is more than just applying new methodologies: it's about 
                        building a culture where adaptation and improvement are embedded in the company's DNA.
