                        There is no denying that the world is more complex than ever. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and automation have transformed all sectors, 
                        altering the way companies operate and people interact. This complexity demands constant adaptation, fast and efficient decision-making, and measures that challenge 
                        known planning and management models.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="left">The Beginning</h2>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Our company was born out of dissatisfaction with how agility has been treated by most organizations and, especially, by professionals in the field. We often hear 
                        from companies and teams that adopt Scrum, for example, that if we make a certain change - even if it aim to improve processes and based on evidence and data - 
                        we will no longer be "running Scrum" because such a change goes against what the methodology guide preaches. Now, what is more important: evolving the service 
                        and responding to changes or "running the framework"? Imagine telling your client that, despite having delayed delivery, your company remained faithful to the 
                        manual. What will their reaction be? They certainly don't care about the model you use, only about the quality and delivery time. Or rather, whether the solution 
                        provided solves their problem in the time they need it.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the traditional management model, known as Waterfall. However, they ended up becoming just pre-fabricated models 
                        that do not take into account the context, challenges and specific needs of each company. In other words, these are formats that foster resistance to change more 
                        than results, and survive on the promise of "fitting any organization". And yes, they even work for some. However, according to studies by PMI and McKinsey, 70% of 
                        agile transformations (i.e., implementations of such frameworks) end in a state where the results are the same, or even worse, than those of the previous context. 
                        And this is after a lot of investment and stress.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We see and treat agility differently!
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="left">What is Agility</h2>

                    <br>
                    
                    <p>
                        The concept comes from the sports world. Think, for example, of a football player: An agile athlete is one who can react to the game context and dodge the 
                        opponent without losing (much) speed or, at least, regaining it quickly. This is the idea that gives rise to our approach. We treat agility not as a mere name 
                        for a set of rigid rules that cannot be waived, but rather as a skill to be developed, just like in sports.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Despite this, we have in-depth knowledge of all the main methodologies used and we take advantage of what they can offer our clients, but we discard everything 
                        else. Although we recognize the value that agile practices have brought by encouraging reflection on more efficient process management than the traditional model, 
                        we do not blindly adopt rules: instead, we seek to understand the company's moment and challenges, and bring to the table only what can be useful for its results.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="left">Approach</h2>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We approach process improvement and the development of organizational maturity in an evolutionary way: we analyze the current scenario, focus on the biggest 
                        points of inefficiency and bring small adjustments and increments that target the biggest bottlenecks, thus generating quick and significant results to disarm 
                        resistance to change and minimize stress, gradually developing the capacity for continuous evolution and agility of your company.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We believe that smooth but accurate improvements, with small and quick victories, are more easily assimilated by employees and the company itself, than large 
                        restructurings brought about by implementations of prefabricated models that ignore the positive points - which could be taken advantage of - and generate 
                        confusion, anxiety, fears and greater need for readaptation.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="left">Outcomes</h2>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Organizational agility:</strong> the ability to adapt to market volatility and respond to customer needs while maintaining a sustainable pace 
                            that fosters growth.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Cost reduction:</strong> healthy workflows reduce waste, improving the profit margin of the operation, which enables the growth of your company.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> development of a culture with an evolutionary stance, of always learning and proactively seeking progress in 
                            situations.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Optimized decision-making:</strong> development of managers and leaders capable of leveraging the expertise of their teams while still having 
                            control of the situation.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Elimination of work overload:</strong> Unburdened employees generate better solutions without the stress of demands, improving the quality of 
                            life at work and making it easier to retain talent.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Transparency:</strong> with clearer processes and rules and effective visualization, management can supervise teams more assertively, with 
                            fewer meetings and reports, enabling a more agile response to challenges.
                        </p>
