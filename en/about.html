                    <h1 class="h1-sobre">About us</h1>
                    <p>
                        We have over 15 years of experience working in different areas, such as software development, logistics, healthcare, data science, construction, sanitation, events, 
                        finance, retail and research - which has given us a large portfolio of knowledge and tools, and the ability to transfer them to other domains.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Agility</h2>

                    <p>
                        Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the traditional management model, known as Waterfall. In this model, the product is planned and developed in its 
                        entirety, and is only delivered when all its parts are ready. In the mid-1930s, the idea of iterative and incremental development emerged, which consists of 
                        starting with a fundamental product and, with each iteration, increasing it with improvements and new features, delivering value in advance and enabling 
                        learning from it, until reaching the final product.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over time, this idea developed into structures that we now call agile methodologies. However, these fell into exactly what they were initially trying to change: 
                        preconceived and rigid models are implemented as if they were sacred, where adjustments to their rules end up not being welcome, generating an excessive focus 
                        on applying them in their entirety and not on delivering value to the customer. Furthermore, the world is not static and each company is a different universe. 
                        Therefore, each organization needs a customized solution for its challenges, segments and objectives.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Our approach</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        The concept comes from the world of sports. An agile athlete can analyze the game, dodge opponents, pass the ball when marked, maintain efficiency and help 
                        the team achieve the goal of the game. To do this, he responds to the game in real time, adapting to the environment. If this player follows rigid and 
                        pre-formulated guidelines, he will end up facing an opponent and losing the ball, or passing it to a teammate at the wrong time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We work with an evolutionary approach, without generating the excessive changes brought about by restructuring or implementing agile models, and provide the 
                        necessary tools for your company's management and employees to analyze scenarios, improve processes, avoid obstacles, solve problems, work together and 
                        deliver quality solutions in the time your client needs, despite market volatility.
                    </p>
