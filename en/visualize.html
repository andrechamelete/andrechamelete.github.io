                        Kanban is a method of managing workflow and organizational evolution, which acts in an experimental and evolutionary way, considering the behavioral and psychological issues involved in change management.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">Kanban practices</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To achieve this, Kanban suggests 6 practices: Visualize; Limit work in progress (WiP); Manage flow; Make policies explicit; Implement feedback loops; and Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The first one, Visualize, is extremely important for the Kanban success and influences all the others, as we will see below.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">The first practice</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The application of this practice begins with the workflow. It is necessary to know which path the demands take through the service so that, in the end, value is delivered to the customer. Here, it is important to pay attention: if you ask a director, the owner of the company or whoever designed the process, they will tell you one thing. However, if you ask those who actually operate the system, it is possible that the answer will be different. And this is of enormous value because, if what is being done is not happening as planned, there is a reason.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        We often imagine something (theory) that, when implemented, does not reflect or does not fit reality. Therefore, hold back the urge to “order” the process to return to what was designed. Remember the first principle of change management: start with what you do today (not with what you imagine should be done). Understand the reasons for this difference. It is likely that very rich information will emerge from this understanding.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">What else should we look at</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the flow, we also visualize the demands in progress (WIP), that is, those that are following this path. This makes it easy to see which stages are congested and which have excess capacity, and start thinking about ways to make it smoother (which results in greater predictability of deliveries).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It is also important to visualize everything that adds to the flow, such as the WiP limits for each step, blocks, policies, cadences, metrics, etc.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>   
                        Understand that, with just this first practice, we can already obtain information to make important decisions, protect the team against abuse of capacity, resolve bottlenecks and blockages, promote transparency and improve services, which demonstrates how powerful the act of visualization is and that it makes all the difference for change management, continuous improvement and organizational evolution.
