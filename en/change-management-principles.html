                        The principles of Change Management are suggested guidelines to generate continuous improvement with high employee engagement, mitigated stress and a focus on solving real problems, starting with the most important and priority ones.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Organizational Culture and Change Management</h2>

                    <p>
                        The behavior of any group is guided by its culture. According to Edgar Schein, organizational culture is “a set of basic assumptions that a group has invented, discovered, or developed to deal with problems of external adaptation and internal integration, and that have worked well enough to be considered valid and taught to new members as the right way to deal with these problems.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In other words, this way of acting may not be the best, but it has an origin and a reason, and these need to be understood and considered when we are going to make changes in order to achieve improvements.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Avoid Resistance to Change</h2>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we need to understand that people resist change because it always affects their identities. "People do not resist change, they resist being changed" (Peter Senge).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this sense, one of the most common mistakes we see today are the so-called revolutions: profound structural changes that disrespect the identity of people, tribes and the organization. When a company tries to “erase” everything that existed in order to, for example, impose a “trend framework”, the message that is sent to employees is “nothing you did was any good”. According to the PMI, 82% of revolutions do not even come close to achieving the desired result.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Think about it: if a company is alive, it's because it did something right. Making this irrelevant is not only a waste (changing something that wasn't necessary), it's also an insult.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Gradual Evolution is the Way</h2>

                    <p>
                        Thus, Kanban proposes a form of evolution based on experimentation and small changes, through its Change Management principles:
                    </p>

                    <p>   
                        <strong>Start with what you do today:</strong> understand the reality of the processes and internal and external dissatisfactions, and respect identities and positions. You won't generate results with changes without understanding the current state and the real problems that need to be solved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Create agreements to seek improvements through evolutionary change:</strong> take it slow! Revolutions are not very effective, they usually only have a superficial impact (without touching the culture) and, therefore, they are difficult to sustain. Seek to imitate nature, with small improvements focused on real and urgent problems, without overloading with changes, and in a way that stressors help to change behavior through needs. Make it clear that changes are intended to evolve, and not merely to follow trends. The result is terrible when employees feel that the changes are not in line with real needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Encourage leadership at all levels:</strong> in addition to creating the agreements of the second principle, we need to encourage people to participate in the evolution. Imposing solutions unilaterally, without considering the wisdom of the existing process and those involved, is a way of alienating them and creating saboteurs. Leadership acts are any positioning in the search for evolution. People are afraid of being the messengers of problems due to the cultures of punishment in many companies. Therefore, they need to feel that the focus is not on punishing the guilty, but on collaborating to reach solutions. Change is more effective when it occurs from the bottom up. When it occurs in the opposite direction, it tends to be superficial, does not affect the culture and is unsustainable.
