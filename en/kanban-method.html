                    <p>
                        Kanban is a method of work management and organizational evolution, inspired by the Japanese system of visual management using cards, which acts in a non-prescriptive, evolutionary and experimental way, seeking to improve companies and services by making them more sustainable, adjusted to the purpose of customers and other stakeholders, more capable of responding to change and free from work overload.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">Evolve without Revolutions</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        “Revolutions” are avoided, i.e., major reformulations that cause disruption with great scope. These are generally too stressful, do not cause changes in behavior or culture - and therefore are not sustainable - and have a failure rate of 80% (PMI data).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        By acting in an evolutionary and experimental way, through small changes (Kaizen), we focus only on what needs to be improved, achieving greater employee engagement and reduced stress. Furthermore, because they are smaller, they are easily undone if necessary. This way, we avoid the waste of changing what is not necessary and we ensure that the organizational culture and employee behavior evolve along with the changes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">The Goal is Continuous Improvement</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kanban is also a non-prescriptive method, as it does not intend to force organizations into a predefined model or format, nor to prescribe pre-made solutions. Although its practices alleviate some problems (for example, the work in progress limit helps reduce overload and capacity abuse), its main purpose is to identify problems and their true causes. From there, you have complete freedom to solve them using the tools you want, without judgment.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The method suggests practices, cadences and even roles that can be applied whenever necessary. However, if they are not implemented in their entirety, you will not be “not practicing Kanban”. In other words, it is understood that it is necessary to implement what is necessary to solve problems and evolve. If something is not necessary, implementing or changing it will be a waste.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The only thing that Kanban does not tolerate (because then you can no longer say that you are practicing Kanban) is stopping seeking evolution. Inertia is not welcome.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">How does it works?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        By mapping and visualizing the workflow, limiting demands under development, monitoring metrics by service, type of order and risk, explaining policies for decision-making and implementing cycles for evaluating and improving the system, it is possible to find problems such as queues and bottlenecks, allow people to have a systemic view of the flow, ensure that important information is widely and quickly disseminated and, thus, be able to respond to market changes more quickly, resulting in a more sustainable, profitable organization with more satisfied customers and employees.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>   
                        Contrary to what many believe, Kanban is not a framework. Therefore, it did not come to compete with Scrum, XP, SAFe, and other formats. If you already use any of these, or even the Waterfall model, and want to improve some points of dissatisfaction, you can use Kanban together, without needing to replace one with the other. Keep what you already do and apply the principles and practices of Kanban to what exists today.
