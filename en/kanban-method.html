                        Managing work efficiently is essential to keeping your company competitive and meeting customer needs. Kanban is a powerful tool for this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kanban is a method of management and continuous improvement of knowledge (or creative) work, acting in an evolutionary and experimental way, which takes into account the delivery of products and services from the customer's perspective.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">The East Gardens of the Imperial Palace</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As David Anderson, the creator of the method, explains in his book “Kanban: A Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business”, in Tokyo there are the Eastern Gardens, in the Imperial Palace. There, although there is no entrance fee, each visitor receives a card, which is returned upon leaving the premises.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of this card is intriguing and ingenious: there is a finite amount of them relative to the capacity of the place. In other words, when there are no more cards, it means that the Gardens have reached their maximum capacity, and new entrants must wait.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This way, the place can ensure safety and cleanliness, as well as maintain a number of people that does not reduce the quality of the tour. After all, people go there to enjoy the beauty of nature, not to see crowds.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In Japanese, the word “kanban” means signal card, just like the entrance cards of the Eastern Gardens.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">Pull vs push systems</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, the Kanban method works for companies. When a demand enters the workflow, it receives a card. The number of these cards reflects the number of demands already committed.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In a mature service flow, where work capacity has been measured, it is easy to see when the team can or cannot receive new demands. In other words, the team “pulls” work according to its capacity, instead of it being pushed into the flow causing congestion and delays.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="left">Operational advantages</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Work preview</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One of the purposes of the method is to generate a clear picture of how work flows in the company and its services. By knowing the stages of the process and its capacity, and the rules for progressing demands, it is possible to manage and reduce bottlenecks, mitigating risks and continuously improving deliveries.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Risk identification</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With this visualization, it is also easy to identify risks: if we have a traffic jam or problem in the flow, we know that the demands of the previous stages may be impacted, which helps to anticipate the search for solutions.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Agile responses</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Thus, the company gains in adaptability, being able to correct its processes and evolve quickly, improving what is really necessary, without needing to implement a pre-established model.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Kanban for teams and organizations</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kanban is often associated with teams, particularly in managing workflow and relieving overwhelm. Teams can use Kanban to regain control over their tasks, ensuring they don't get overwhelmed and are working on the right priorities at the right time. This can help them increase productivity and reduce stress.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, Kanban gains momentum when applied on a larger scale. Using the method across a service line and for project and portfolio management can significantly increase an organization's efficiency. Kanban becomes an organizational development tool, enabling departments and teams to work together more effectively while maintaining a customer-centric approach.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Kanban goals</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kanban is also a non-prescriptive method because it does not intend to lead organizations to a predefined model or format, nor to prescribe pre-made solutions. Instead, Kanban aims to:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Alignment between teams and departments: With a service-focused approach, multiple teams or departments can work in harmony, sharing the same goals and reducing silos.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Improved service delivery: As work becomes more agile across multiple teams, companies can deliver better and faster results to their customers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Continuous improvement: Kanban encourages ongoing evaluation and refinement of workflows, leading to long-term improvements in efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="left">Conclusion</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Kanban is more than just a tool for managing tasks — it's a strategic approach to improving your company's operations, customer service, and adaptability. By visualizing workflows, managing risk, and driving continuous improvement, Kanban equips your company to thrive in an ever-evolving marketplace.
